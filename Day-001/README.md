## What I Learned Today

### HTML Boilerplate Structure
Today I learned the essential HTML boilerplate that forms the foundation of every web page. The boilerplate is the basic HTML structure that every HTML document should have.

### Basic HTML Boilerplate Code

### HTML CODE - EXPLAIN
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

### Breaking Down Each Component
#### 1. <!DOCTYPE html>

Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document

Must be the first line in any HTML file

Not case-sensitive but typically written in uppercase

#### 2. <html lang="en">

Root element that wraps all content

lang="en" specifies the language (English)

Helps screen readers and search engines

#### 3. <head> Section

Contains metadata (information about the document)

Not visible to users on the webpage

Includes important information for browsers and search engines

#### 4. <meta charset="UTF-8">

Specifies character encoding

UTF-8 supports all characters and symbols

Prevents display issues with special characters

#### 5. <meta name="viewport">

Makes the website responsive on mobile devices

width=device-width sets width to device screen width

initial-scale=1.0 sets initial zoom level

#### 6. <title>

Text that appears in browser tab

Important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Should be descriptive and unique for each page

#### 7. <body>

Contains all visible content

Where all HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images go
