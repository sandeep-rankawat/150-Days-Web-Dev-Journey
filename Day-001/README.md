Root element that wraps all content

lang="en" specifies the language (English)

#### 4. <meta charset="UTF-8">

Specifies character encoding

UTF-8 supports all characters and symbols

Prevents display issues with special characters

#### 5. <meta name="viewport">

width=device-width sets width to device screen width

initial-scale=1.0 sets initial zoom level

#### 6. <title>

Text that appears in browser tab

Important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
